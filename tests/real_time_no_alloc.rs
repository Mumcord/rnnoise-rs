//! Real-time gate (issue #4): once the state is built, `process_frame` must perform
//! **no heap allocation**.
//!
//! Exactly one `#[test]` in this file on purpose: `#[global_allocator]` is process-wide,
//! so a test running concurrently with another one would see that test's allocations. The
//! counter is scoped to the thread that owns the window (`OWNER`), which makes it robust
//! even under the default parallel harness.
//!
//! This is the enforceable half of the contract documented in `doc/realtime.md`: the frame
//! path uses fixed-size buffers, so a refactor that reaches for a `Vec`, a `Box`, a
//! `format!` or a lazy static inside `process_frame` fails here rather than in the field.

// Test island: `GlobalAlloc` is unsafe by trait definition, and the counting allocator is
// the whole point of this file.
#![allow(unsafe_code)]

// SAFETY: every method reads two already-initialised statics, increments a static atomic
// counter, and then delegates to the system allocator. Nothing is read through a pointer
// the allocator did not get from `System`, no layout is recomputed, and the counting check
// itself allocates nothing — which is what would make recursion possible.
